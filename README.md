# Memory Game

This memory game (also known as "Concentration") was created as a part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). It is a browser-based card game.

## Game logic

The game contains 8 pairs of randomly shuffled cards. In each turn of the game, the player flips over two cards to reveal their symbols. If a pair is found, the matched cards stay flipped over. Otherwise the cards of the current turn are flipped face down again.

The player wins once all matching cards have been found.

The number of allowed attempts is unlimited, but the game includes a star rating. Based on the number of failed attemps, the rating decreases gradually, from five stars down to one star.
